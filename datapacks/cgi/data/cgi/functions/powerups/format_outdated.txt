A note on armorstand timers:
- Rather than incrementing EVERY stand's timer by 1 until it reaches a tick threshold, this method uses gameTime (which constantly incrementss by 1 every tick) to generate a time in the future when the next part of the function should execute.
- For example, to wait for 1s (20 ticks), run:
    scoreboard players operation @e[type=armor_stand,name=WHATEVER] time = gameTime data
    scoreboard players add @e[type=armor_stand,name=WHATEVER] 20
- Then, just avoid executing the next part until time==gameTime (the game clock has "caught up" to its own)

THE ALL IN ONE* GUIDE TO CGI POWERUPS:
(* ONE is a registered trademark that means several)

___________

1: [in powerloop] check for appropriate entity, summon armor stand
    execute as @e[type=chicken,name=Virus] at @s run summon armor_stand ~ ~ ~ {CustomName:"\"Virus\"", Invisible:1b,NoGravity:1b}

2: [also in powerloop], check for any armorstands, run their corresponding helper function
    execute as @e[type=armor_stand,name=Virus] at @s run function cgi:powerups/virus

___

3.0.1, 3.1.1, ..., 3.n.1: [in helper function]. For each part of the powerup code (separated into time blocks), check both for the appropriate TAG, and a matching TIME. If both match, run the function containing that part of the code.
    execute as @e[type=armor_stand,name=Virus,tag=s0] at @s if score @s time <= gameTime data run function cgi:/powerups/sub_virus/virus1
The command to run [powerup]0 doesn't need a time check, but it should ensure that the armorstand does not have any tags that would have it run other parts:
    execute as @e[type=armor_stand,name=Virus,tag=!s0,tag=!s1...tag=!sN] at @s run function cgi:powerups/sub_virus/virus0

3.0.2, 3.1.2, ..., 3.n.2: [IN EACH part of the sub code (virus1, virus2, etc.)], run whatever you need to make the powerup work, but at the end, reset the tag & time for the next stage
    fill ~-3 ~-1 ~-3 ~3 ~-1 ~3 air 0 replace stained_glass 
    tag @s remove s0
    tag @s add s1
    scoreboard players operation @s time = gameTime data
    scoreboard players add @s time 20

4: [in the LAST sub function], don't forget to cleanup
    kill @s

Note: tag & time for each stage represents the most general case. If the powerup is only 1 stage, you can do everything in powerup[0], and just kill the armorstand at the end.
